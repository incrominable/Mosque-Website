      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>It all stems from one man, in 1978, who traversed the throes of knowledge; an ascetic individual who constantly reminded himself of his final resting place. This man had always pondered on what action he could commit himself to in order to have a lasting effect on the Muslim community. This was until he came across the following video, reminding himself of how worthless his wealth will be…

      <p>…this was the foundation of Bangor Islamic Mosque. At the beginning, he and a group of thirty people would meet in their respective homes and pray there, slowly gathering a following of those who wanted to pray in congregation. They then moved on to renting small spaces to accommodate the growing group, with more people willing to invest to allow a form of permanent residence.</p>
      <p>Nabil, seeing their current situation, took it upon himself to finally kickstart the project which would serve to be the beacon of the community in Bangor. He tirelessly reached out to contacts for fundraising as they eventually bought an abandoned building that had once been a community center. While it was in dire need of repair, it stood as the forefront of what is now Bangor Islamic Mosque.</p>
      <p>As the community began to flourish, the mosque became a hub of activity, offering not only a place for prayer but also a center for studies and gatherings. It introduced events from Sunday Islamic classes to providing community dinners on special occasions. The Friday & ‘Eid prayers in particular drew the largest crowd from the community.</p>
      <p>This is the story of Bangor Islamic Mosque, one that is still seeing an exponential amount of growth to this day.</p>
